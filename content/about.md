# Hello!

My name is Aidan and I'm a first year student at Seattle University

I've had an difficult time navigating my way through various technical issues, with my struggles and solutions documented for others to (hopefully) use!
This blog will only follow my struggles from my first year at university onward, as attempting to backfill the mountains of sites, documents, and white pages i've used to find success throughout the years would make it impossible to stay current.
